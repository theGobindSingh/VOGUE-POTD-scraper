# VOGUE Pics Of The Day scraper

This is a simple Python Program which scrapes 16 images from Vogue ( https://www.vogue.it/en/photovogue/Portfolio/Archive/PicOfDay/ ) 

By default, it saves the images in a folder "vogue" in your Documents naming each image as the title given by the photographer.

Most pictures which I see right now are portrait, So maybe they could be a decent wallpaper for phones. (There may be some nude images.)
